## Session Notes

_(Participants: add your research, ideas, and recommendations below)_

### Mary (Analyst) â€” Research & Use Cases

**Primary Users:** Healthcare SaaS product teams (developers, PMs, designers, marketers)

**Use Cases:**
- Product planning & requirements (invite medical expertise early)
- Feature design reviews (patient safety, clinical accuracy)
- Content creation (in-app guidance, patient education, training)
- Marketing collaboration (messaging that's medically sound + patient-centered)
- Compliance review (HIPAA, PHI, security)
- EHR integration planning (workflows, data models)

**Pain Points We're Solving:**
1. Forgetting the patient â€” features that miss patient experience/needs
2. Medical inaccuracy â€” content/features that aren't clinically sound
3. Security/compliance gaps â€” PHI exposure, HIPAA violations
4. Lack of domain expertise â€” dev teams don't know what they don't know

- **Priority workflows:** `*clinical-review` (story reviews), `*marketing-collab` (messaging)

**Dependencies:**
- Medical terminology databases (SNOMED, RxNorm, ICD-10)
- Clinical guidelines (CDC, WHO)
- HIPAA/HITECH regulations
- EHR standards (HL7 FHIR)
- Module dependencies: bmm, bmb

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- Medical inaccuracy â†’ Include disclaimers + validation workflows
- Compliance gaps â†’ Privacy Officer + audit checklists

**Next Steps:**
1. Create detailed agent YAML specs (9 files)
2. Create workflow definitions (8 folders with workflow.yaml + instructions.md)
3. Validate installer config
4. Test `*clinical-review` and `*marketing-collab` end-to-end
