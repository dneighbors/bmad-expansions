### Stories

1. (E1) Create example pack scaffold at repo root
   - As a maintainer, I want a minimal pack with `agents/`, `workflows/`, `_module-installer/`, and `README.md` so that others can copy it.
   - Acceptance: Folder exists with required subfolders and example files.

2. (E1) Provide installer config template
   - As a maintainer, I want a boilerplate `_module-installer/install-config.yaml` so new packs start with correct fields.
   - Acceptance: Template includes `code`, `name`, `description`, `version`, `default_selected`, `dependencies`.

3. (E2) Document `*create-module` usage
   - As an author, I need steps to generate a module scaffold with BMB.
   - Acceptance: Doc includes trigger usage and expected output paths.

4. (E2) Document `*create-agent` flow and output locations
   - As an author, I need to create agents and know where files go in this repo.
   - Acceptance: Agent YAML example compiles during install in a target project.

5. (E2) Document `*create-workflow` flow and structure
   - As an author, I need to generate workflow folders (`workflow.yaml`, `instructions.md`, etc.).
   - Acceptance: Example workflow validates with core executor.

6. (E3) Add rsync script for syncing packs into BMAD-METHOD
   - As a maintainer, I want a one-liner or script to sync all packs into `BMAD-METHOD/src/modules/`.

7. (E3) Document git subtree alternative
   - As a team, we want an option to vendor packs with history.
   - Acceptance: Steps show add, pull, and split commands with example paths.

8. (E4) Document installer command for target projects (Cursor)
   - As a developer, I want a known-good command to install packs into a project and generate `.cursor/rules/`.
   - Acceptance: Command includes `--ides cursor`; verified in a sample project.

9. (E4) Define update procedure (re-sync + re-install)
   - As a maintainer, I want a clear flow to propagate pack changes to targets.
   - Acceptance: Steps verified; artifacts regenerated without manual edits.

10. (E4) Add verification checklist for installs/updates
    - As a QA, I need a checklist to confirm expected outputs in targets.
