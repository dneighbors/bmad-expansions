# Story 17: Establish and Document BMB-First Policy

**Epic:** E2 - Authoring with BMAD Builder (BMB)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 01 (policy establishment)  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS

---

## User Story

As a **maintainer**, I want **documented policy requiring all future agents/workflows use BMB workflows** so that **we maintain quality standards and demonstrate proper methodology**.

---

## Context

Sprint 01 taught us a critical lesson: taking shortcuts (bash scripts) creates technical debt. The validation work proved that BMB workflows produce significantly higher quality output:

- ‚úÖ Correct format (`.agent.yaml` not `.md`)
- ‚úÖ Rich configuration (6-8 fields not 0-1)
- ‚úÖ Detailed workflows (300+ lines not TODO stubs)
- ‚úÖ BMAD Core compliant
- ‚úÖ 3-4x higher quality

**Key Principle:** "If we're selling a methodology, we must USE that methodology."

This story establishes BMB-first as the mandatory process going forward.

## Policy Summary

### BMB-First Mandate

**Effective immediately:** All new agents, workflows, and modules MUST be created using BMB workflows.

**Required Workflows:**
- `@bmad-builder *create-agent` for all agents
- `@bmad-builder *create-workflow` for all workflows
- `@bmad-builder *create-module` for all modules

**Prohibited:**
- ‚ùå Bash scripts to generate agents
- ‚ùå Manual `.md` file creation
- ‚ùå Copy-paste from templates
- ‚ùå Bulk generation tools

**Quality Standards:**
- ‚úÖ Agents in `.agent.yaml` format
- ‚úÖ 6+ interactive configuration fields per module
- ‚úÖ 200+ line workflow instructions
- ‚úÖ Conditional team assembly where appropriate
- ‚úÖ BMAD Core compliance

---

## Rationale

### Why BMB-First?

1. **Dogfooding** - We must use our own methodology
2. **Quality** - BMB produces 3-4x higher quality
3. **Compliance** - Ensures BMAD Core standards
4. **Documentation** - Can authentically document what we do
5. **Credibility** - Shows we practice what we preach

### Cost-Benefit

**Time Investment:** 42x longer (5 hours vs 30 minutes)  
**Quality Improvement:** 3-4x better output  
**Verdict:** Worth it for quality and credibility
