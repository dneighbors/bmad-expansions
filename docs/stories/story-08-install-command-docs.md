## User Story

As a developer, I want a known-good command to install packs into a project and generate `.cursor/rules/`.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation shows install command with `--ides cursor` flag
2. Includes example with medical, marketing, blog packs
3. Shows expected outputs (module folders, Cursor artifacts)
4. Verified in a sample Cursor project
5. Includes troubleshooting section (common errors)
6. Documents required prerequisites (Node.js, bmad-cli path)

---

## Notes

- Critical for enabling pack adoption
- Should reference EXPANSIONS-SETUP.md install section
