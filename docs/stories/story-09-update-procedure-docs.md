# Story 9: Define Update Procedure (Re-sync + Re-install)

**Epic:** E4 — Install Packs into Target Projects  
**Epic Reference:** [docs/epics/04-install-into-targets.md](../epics/04-install-into-targets.md)  
**Priority:** P2  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Assigned:** Unassigned  
**Status:** Backlog

---

## User Story

As a maintainer, I want a clear flow to propagate pack changes to targets.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation shows update workflow: edit pack → sync → reinstall
2. Steps verified end-to-end with a sample pack update
3. Confirms artifacts regenerate without manual edits
4. Includes rollback procedure (if update breaks targets)
5. Documents version management best practices

---

## Notes

- Depends on Story 15 (sync script) and Story 8 (install docs)
- Ensures smooth update lifecycle
