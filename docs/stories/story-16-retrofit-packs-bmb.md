# Story 16: Retrofit Existing Packs to BMB Format

**Epic:** E2 - Authoring with BMAD Builder (BMB)  
**Sprint:** Sprint 01 (retroactive cleanup)  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)  
**Status:** üîÑ IN PROGRESS

---

## User Story

As a **maintainer**, I want to **replace script-generated packs with proper BMB-generated versions** so that **all expansion packs comply with BMAD Core standards and demonstrate proper methodology**.

---

## Context

During Sprint 01, we created medical, marketing, and blog packs using custom bash scripts instead of BMB workflows. This created technical debt:

- ‚ùå Wrong format (`.md` instead of `.agent.yaml`)
- ‚ùå Minimal configuration (0-1 fields instead of 6-8)
- ‚ùå Generic quality (TODO stubs instead of detailed guides)
- ‚ùå Non-compliant with BMAD Core standards
- ‚ùå Can't document authentically (didn't use our own tools)

Validation work (sprint-01-validation branch) created proper BMB versions:
- ‚úÖ medical-bmad/ (2 agents + 1 workflow, 6 config fields)
- ‚úÖ marketing-bmad/ (2 agents + 1 workflow, 7 config fields)  
- ‚úÖ blog-bmad/ (2 agents + 1 workflow, 8 config fields)

This story retrofits the repo to use BMB versions as the canonical packs.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All script-generated packs deleted
- [ ] BMB versions renamed to canonical names
- [ ] All references updated (no "-bmad" suffixes)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Sync script validated
- [ ] All changes committed to sprint-01-validation branch
- [ ] Branch ready for merge to main

## Notes

### Why This Matters
- Ensures all packs comply with BMAD Core standards
- Demonstrates dogfooding (using our own methodology)
- Provides authentic examples for documentation
- Establishes quality baseline for future packs

### Retroactive Sprint Assignment
This work is assigned to Sprint 01 retroactively because:
1. It corrects Sprint 01 shortcuts
2. Should have been done properly from the start
3. Validation proved BMB approach is superior

### Link to Validation Work
- **Branch:** sprint-01-validation
- **Comparison:** FINAL-COMPARISON.md
- **Samples:** medical-bmad/, marketing-bmad/, blog-bmad/
