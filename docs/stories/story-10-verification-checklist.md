**Epic:** E4 — Install Packs into Target Projects  
**Epic Reference:** [docs/epics/04-install-into-targets.md](../epics/04-install-into-targets.md)  
**Priority:** Deferred to Sprint 02  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Assigned:** Unassigned  
**Status:** Backlog

## User Story

As a QA, I need a checklist to confirm expected outputs in targets.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Checklist created at `docs/verification-checklist.md`
2. Covers modules copied to target project
3. Covers agents compiled (YAML → .md)
4. Covers Cursor artifacts generated (`.cursor/rules/*`)
5. Includes validation commands (file existence checks)
6. Includes smoke test procedures (invoke an agent, run a workflow)

## Notes

- Deferred to Sprint 02: Defer until install flow is validated end-to-end
- Supports quality assurance and troubleshooting
