# Story 12: Scaffold Medical Pack via BMB

**Epic:** E2 â€” Authoring with BMAD Builder (BMB)  
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Assigned:** Developer  
**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## User Story

As an author, I want the `medical` pack scaffolded using official BMB workflows so that healthcare SaaS teams can invite medical expertise into their product/dev/marketing workflows.

---

## Discovery Reference

See completed discovery session: `docs/discovery/medical-pack-discovery.md`

**Target Users:** Healthcare SaaS product teams (developers, PMs, designers, marketers)

**Pain Points Solved:**
1. Forgetting the patient â€” features that miss patient experience/needs
2. Medical inaccuracy â€” content/features that aren't clinically sound
3. Security/compliance gaps â€” PHI exposure, HIPAA violations
4. Lack of domain expertise â€” dev teams don't know what they don't know

---

### 2. Create 8 Workflow Folders

Use BMB `*create-workflow` to create each workflow in `medical/workflows/`:

1. **clinical-review/** â€” Multi-agent clinical review (ðŸ”¥ PRIORITY)
   - Team: Dr. Johnson, Nurse Hinsley, Ashley Rutledge, Dr. Kim, Lisa Chang
   - Input: Feature spec, user story, or design artifact
   - Output: Clinical validation report with safety/accuracy/compliance findings
   - Steps: Load artifact â†’ multi-agent review â†’ generate report â†’ save findings

2. **patient-content/** â€” Patient-facing content creation
   - Team: Maya Patel, Nurse Hinsley (validation)
   - Input: Content brief, target audience, medical topic
   - Output: Patient education materials (plain language, medically accurate)

3. **ehr-integration-plan/** â€” EHR integration design
   - Team: Marcus Thompson
   - Input: Integration requirements, EHR system details
   - Output: Data model, workflow mapping, FHIR resource specs

4. **drug-safety-check/** â€” Medication feature review
   - Team: Dr. Kim, Dr. Johnson
   - Input: Medication feature spec, drug database design
   - Output: Safety analysis (interactions, dosing, contraindications)

5. **hipaa-audit/** â€” Compliance review
   - Team: Lisa Chang

**Each workflow must include:**
- `workflow.yaml` with config (name, description, team agents, inputs, outputs)
- `instructions.md` with step-by-step execution logic
- `README.md` with usage examples
- `checklist.md` (validation criteria)

---

### 3. Update Medical Pack README

Create compelling `medical/README.md` that includes:
- Pack purpose and value proposition
- Target users (healthcare SaaS teams)
- Agent roster with 1-sentence descriptions
- Workflow catalog with triggers and use cases
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples (how to invoke agents/workflows)
- Medical disclaimer
- Dependencies (bmm, bmb)

**Tone:** Professional, clear, emphasizes patient safety + clinical accuracy

---

### 4. Validate Installer Config

Ensure `medical/_module-installer/install-config.yaml` includes:
- `code: medical`
- `name: "Medical Pack"`
- `description: "Clinical expertise agents for healthcare SaaS teams"`
- `version: "0.1.0"`
- `dependencies: [bmm, bmb]`

---

### 5. Test Priority Workflows

Manually test these workflows end-to-end:
1. `*clinical-review` â€” Review a sample user story
2. `*marketing-collab` â€” Generate marketing content for a sample feature

Verify:
- Workflows load without errors
- Agents activate correctly
- Outputs match expected format
- Medical disclaimers are present

---

## Technical Notes

- Use BMB workflows (`*create-agent`, `*create-workflow`) â€” do NOT manually code YAML/instructions
- Agent YAMLs compile to `.md` during installation in target projects
- All medical content must include disclaimer: "This is not a substitute for professional medical advice"
- PHI handling workflows must reference HIPAA compliance

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] 9 agent YAML files created in `medical/agents/`
- [ ] 8 workflow folders created in `medical/workflows/`
- [ ] `medical/README.md` updated (compelling, complete)
- [ ] Installer config validated
- [ ] `*clinical-review` tested successfully
- [ ] `*marketing-collab` tested successfully
- [ ] All files committed to `main`
- [ ] Discovery doc reference added to README

---
