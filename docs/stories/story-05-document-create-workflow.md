## User Story

As an author, I need to generate workflow folders (`workflow.yaml`, `instructions.md`, etc.).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation shows `*create-workflow` workflow usage
2. Explains workflow folder structure (workflow.yaml, instructions.md, README.md, checklist.md)
3. Shows example workflow YAML
4. Demonstrates workflow validation with core executor
5. Links to workflow.xml (core workflow engine)

## Notes

- Medical pack has 8 workflows created via this process
- Ensures workflows are compatible with BMAD workflow engine
