# Story 28: Complete Workflow Files for All Packs

**Epic:** E2 (Authoring with BMB)  
**Status:** üÜï NEW (Sprint 02)  
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL  
**Story Points:** 21

---

## User Story

As a user installing expansion packs, I want all workflows to be fully functional with complete instructions, checklists, and READMEs so that I can actually execute workflows from Cursor.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State (v1.0 - Sprint 01)
- ‚ùå Only `workflow.yaml` files created for all workflows
- ‚ùå Missing `instructions.md` - Detailed step-by-step execution guide
- ‚ùå Missing `checklist.md` - Validation/completion checklist
- ‚ùå Missing `README.md` - Workflow overview and quick reference
- ‚ùå Workflows don't appear in Cursor `.cursor/rules/` after installation
- ‚ùå Users cannot execute workflows even though they're "installed"

### Root Cause
Sprint 01 focused on rapid delivery of agents and workflow configurations. To meet sprint goals, only `workflow.yaml` files were created. This was sufficient for structural validation but insufficient for end-user functionality.

### Impact
- **Severity:** HIGH - Workflows are non-functional
- **Scope:** 38 workflows across 3 packs (Marketing: 15, Medical: 8, Blog: 15)
- **User Experience:** Users see agents but no workflows after installation
- **Workaround:** None - workflows cannot be executed without these files

## Acceptance Criteria

### Marketing Pack (15 workflows √ó 3 files = 45 files)
- [ ] All 15 workflows have `instructions.md` with detailed step-by-step guides
- [ ] All 15 workflows have `checklist.md` with validation criteria
- [ ] All 15 workflows have `README.md` with overview and usage
- [ ] Workflows appear in `.cursor/rules/bmad/marketing/workflows/` after install
- [ ] Test: Execute `*marketing-strategy` workflow end-to-end

### Medical Pack (8 workflows √ó 3 files = 24 files)
- [ ] All 8 workflows have `instructions.md`
- [ ] All 8 workflows have `checklist.md`
- [ ] All 8 workflows have `README.md`
- [ ] Workflows appear in `.cursor/rules/bmad/medical/workflows/` after install
- [ ] Test: Execute `*clinical-review` workflow end-to-end

### Blog Pack (15 workflows √ó 3 files = 45 files)
- [ ] All 15 workflows have `instructions.md`
- [ ] All 15 workflows have `checklist.md`
- [ ] All 15 workflows have `README.md`
- [ ] Workflows appear in `.cursor/rules/bmad/blog/workflows/` after install

## File Structure Required

Each workflow folder must contain:

```
workflow-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflow.yaml        ‚úÖ EXISTS (created in Sprint 01)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ instructions.md      ‚ùå MISSING (create in Sprint 02)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checklist.md         ‚ùå MISSING (create in Sprint 02)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            ‚ùå MISSING (create in Sprint 02)
```

## Example: Complete Workflow Files

### `instructions.md` Template
```markdown
# [Workflow Name] ‚Äî Instructions

## Overview
[Brief description of what this workflow accomplishes]

## Team
- **Lead Agent:** [Agent name and role]
- **Supporting Agents:** [Other agents involved]

## Prerequisites
- [List of inputs, data, or context needed]

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
1. **[Step Name]**
   - Agent: [Which agent performs this]
   - Action: [What they do]
   - Output: [What's produced]
   - Validation: [How to verify success]

[Continue for all phases...]

## Output
- [List of deliverables]
- Location: {output_folder}/[filename]

## Validation
- [ ] [Completion criteria 1]
- [ ] [Completion criteria 2]
```

### `checklist.md` Template
```markdown
# [Workflow Name] ‚Äî Validation Checklist

## Pre-Execution
- [ ] All required inputs gathered
- [ ] Team agents available
- [ ] Output folder configured

## Execution Quality
- [ ] All workflow steps completed
- [ ] Agent responses reviewed
- [ ] Output files generated

## Output Validation
- [ ] [Specific quality criteria]
- [ ] [Format compliance checks]
- [ ] [Completeness verification]

## Post-Execution
- [ ] Output saved to correct location
- [ ] Workflow documented for future reference
- [ ] Feedback captured for improvement
```

### `README.md` Template
```markdown
# [Workflow Name]

**Description:** [One-line description]

## Quick Start

\```
@[lead-agent]
*[workflow-trigger]

[Example input]
\```

## What It Does
[2-3 sentence explanation]

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Template Creation (2 points)
1. Create master templates for instructions.md, checklist.md, README.md
2. Document file format standards
3. Review with team

### Phase 2: Priority Workflows (8 points)
Create complete files for highest-priority workflows:
- Marketing: `*marketing-strategy`, `*ppc-campaign`, `*social-campaign`
- Medical: `*clinical-review`, `*hipaa-audit`
- Blog: `*daily-content-system`, `*blog-post-creation`

### Phase 3: Batch Completion (11 points)
Complete remaining workflows using templates:
- Marketing: 12 remaining workflows
- Medical: 6 remaining workflows  
- Blog: 13 remaining workflows

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (2 points)
- Install all 3 packs in test project
- Verify all workflows appear in Cursor
- Execute 1 workflow per pack end-to-end
- Document any installation issues

---

## Dependencies

- ‚úÖ Story 16/17: BMB-format agents complete
- ‚úÖ Sprint 01: workflow.yaml files exist
- ‚úÖ BMAD Core: Workflow installer supports all file types
- ‚è≥ CONTRIBUTING.md: Document workflow file requirements

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk:** 114 files is significant scope creep  
**Mitigation:** Use templates and scripting for consistency; prioritize critical workflows first

**Risk:** Quality varies across 38 workflows  
**Mitigation:** Review samples from each pack; establish quality bar before batch creation

**Risk:** Discovery sessions didn't detail workflow steps  
**Mitigation:** Infer from workflow.yaml variables and team composition; validate with stakeholders

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Each workflow has all 4 required files
- [ ] Files follow template structure
- [ ] Agent references are valid
- [ ] Config paths are correct

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Sync script succeeds with complete workflows
- [ ] BMAD installer discovers all workflows
- [ ] Workflows appear in `.cursor/rules/`
- [ ] No installation errors or warnings

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] User can trigger workflow from Cursor
- [ ] Instructions are clear and actionable
- [ ] Agents reference correct config values
- [ ] Output files generate correctly

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 38 workflows have complete 4-file structure (114 new files)
- [ ] Files follow BMB standards and templates
- [ ] Test installation succeeds for all 3 packs
- [ ] All workflows visible in Cursor after install
- [ ] 3 priority workflows tested end-to-end (1 per pack)
- [ ] Documentation updated with workflow completeness status
- [ ] Sprint 01 validation testing can be re-run successfully

---

## Notes

This story represents technical debt from Sprint 01's rapid delivery focus. The structural foundation (workflow.yaml) is solid, but user-facing content is incomplete. This is a known limitation documented in Sprint 01 retrospective.

**Estimated Effort Breakdown:**
- Template creation: 2 points
- Priority workflows (7 √ó 3 files): 8 points  
- Batch completion (31 √ó 3 files): 11 points
- Testing and validation: 2 points
- **Total: 21 points**

**Sprint 02 Allocation:**
This represents roughly 40% of a typical sprint capacity. Consider splitting into Story 28a (Priority workflows) and Story 28b (Batch completion) if needed.
