## User Story

As a maintainer, I want a minimal pack with `agents/`, `workflows/`, `_module-installer/`, and `README.md` so that others can copy it.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Example pack folder exists at repo root (e.g., `example-pack/`)
2. Contains required subfolders: `agents/`, `workflows/`, `_module-installer/`
3. Includes `README.md` with pack purpose and structure
4. Includes valid `_module-installer/install-config.yaml`
5. Contains at least 1 example agent YAML
6. Contains at least 1 example workflow folder

## Notes

- Deferred to Sprint 02: We already have 3 real packs (medical, marketing, blog)
- This provides a template for future pack authors
