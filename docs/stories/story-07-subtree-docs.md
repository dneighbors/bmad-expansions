# Story 7: Document Git Subtree Alternative

**Epic:** E3 â€” Discovery and Sync Bridge  
**Epic Reference:** [docs/epics/03-discovery-and-sync-bridge.md](../epics/03-discovery-and-sync-bridge.md)  
**Priority:** Deferred to Sprint 02  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Assigned:** Unassigned  
**Status:** Backlog

---

## User Story

As a team, we want an option to vendor packs with history.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Documentation added showing git subtree workflow
2. Includes `git subtree add` command with example paths
3. Includes `git subtree pull` for updates
4. Includes `git subtree split` for extracting changes
5. Explains pros/cons vs. rsync approach
6. Provides decision matrix (when to use rsync vs. subtree)

---

## Notes

- Deferred to Sprint 02: Rsync (Story 15) is sufficient for MVP
- Subtree is nice-to-have for teams preferring versioned vendoring
