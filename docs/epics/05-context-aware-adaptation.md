# Epic 05: Context-Aware Adaptation

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ BACKLOG (Post-MVP)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 21-34 points (3-4 sprints)

---

## Overview

Make expansion pack agents and workflows truly adaptive to user configuration, automatically tailoring language, examples, recommendations, and complexity based on installer responses.

**Current State (v1.0):**
- Configuration captured during installation
- Values saved to `config.yaml` and available to agents
- Agents have access but don't automatically adapt
- Users must explicitly reference context in prompts

**Desired State:**
- Agents automatically adapt personas to user industry/context
- Workflows filter options based on maturity level
- Examples and recommendations match user's specific situation
- Disclaimers toggle on/off based on user preference
- Agent language reflects user's target audience (B2B vs B2C)

---

## Business Value

### Why This Matters

**User Experience:**
- Reduces cognitive load - agents "just know" your context
- More relevant recommendations without restating context
- Faster time-to-value - no need to teach agents your situation

**Differentiation:**
- Expansion packs feel like custom-built solutions
- Demonstrates BMAD's contextual AI capabilities
- Justifies premium positioning vs. generic prompts

**Adoption:**
- Lower barrier to effective use
- Better first-run experience
- Higher perceived value from installation questions

---

## Success Metrics

- **Relevance Score:** 80%+ of agent responses reference user context appropriately
- **User Feedback:** "Feels like it was built for my business" sentiment
- **Prompt Length:** 30% reduction in prompt length (users don't re-state context)
- **Configuration Completion:** 95%+ of users complete installer questions
- **Perceived Value:** Config questions seen as value-add, not friction

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Template Engine Enhancement
- Add conditional logic support to agent persona templates
- Support variable interpolation: `{config:company_industry}`
- Enable if/else blocks: `{{#if marketing_maturity equals "Startup"}}...{{/if}}`

### Phase 2: Agent Persona Adaptation
- Refactor agent `.agent.yaml` personas to use conditional blocks
- Create industry-specific example libraries
- Build maturity-level complexity filters

### Phase 3: Workflow Configuration
- Add config-based default value population
- Filter workflow options based on user context
- Pre-select channels/platforms based on audience type

### Phase 4: Resource Libraries
- Create industry-specific framework libraries
- Build EHR-vendor integration guides
- Develop specialty-specific clinical examples

## Dependencies

- **BMAD Core:** Template engine with conditional logic support
- **Config System:** Reliable config loading in agent activation
- **Story 16/17:** BMB-format agents with proper activation blocks

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Over-personalization reduces agent flexibility
- **Mitigation:** Keep base agent knowledge broad, layer context on top
- **Fallback:** Users can always override with explicit prompts

**Risk:** Configuration becomes too complex
- **Mitigation:** Sensible defaults for all questions, optional skip
- **Progressive disclosure:** Start simple, add depth over time

**Risk:** Template logic makes agents harder to maintain
- **Mitigation:** Clear documentation, linting for conditional blocks
- **Testing:** Automated tests for each config combination

---

## Future Enhancements (Beyond Epic 05)

- **Learning from Usage:** Agents learn preferred channels/tactics from past interactions
- **Dynamic Agent Assembly:** Only activate agents matching user's focus areas
- **Cross-Pack Context:** Medical pack aware of marketing pack's target audience
- **A/B Testing:** Test config-driven recommendations vs. generic

- Dynamic agent roster based on selections
- Real-time config updates without reinstall
- Multi-tenant config (teams with different contexts)
